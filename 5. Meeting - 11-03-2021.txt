
Show changes you did to data (removed samples etc.)
Find zero value genes with low variance and remove
Make plan: ideas for supervised approaches
	Decision trees
		Gradient boosting
	Perceptrons (not that transparent)
	Principal components (not interpretable)
	Support vector machine (SVM)
	Iso cluster

ZEROES causes worse predictions

Classify data
Try finding your own labels (clusters etc.)
Test split how
